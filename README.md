When using something like ASP.NET Web API, it’s a fairly common pattern to have a whole stack of CRUD REST services. Refit now supports these, allowing you to define a single API interface with a generic type.

This allowed us to avoid dealing with complex HTTP logic, such as creating request messages and deserializing responses and instead focus on the core logic relating to our applications.
